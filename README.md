# DU_bootcamp_homework_5_Day_Planner

A Daily Planner made with Jquery

In this assignment we were given the task to create a daily planner using Jquery.

The site needed to show a list of the hours in a business day.
Each hour shuold be a textbox to write a note of the daily business and then be able to save this info so we can return
and view it later.

Our project also had us use the Moment.js library. It was a nice way to be able to apply the current date or hour with only a few lines of code.

I like how this project really shows just how much we can make in a short period of time using things like Jquery and moment js. I feel like after a couple weeks with the basic we were given power tools.
